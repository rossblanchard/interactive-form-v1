# Treehouse FullStack JavaScript Tech Degree
# Interactive Form Project

In this project, I'm attempting an Exceeds Expectations ruling from the graders.

The following conditions have been met in the application:

* Project includes jQuery and utilizes it in at least some aspect of the form.
* On page load, the cursor appears in the "Name" field, ready for a user to type
* The job role" text field appears when user selects "Other" from the Job Role menu.
* "Until a theme is selected from the “Design” menu, no color options appear in the “Color” drop down and the “Color” field reads “Please select a T-shirt theme”.
* Color” drop down menu is hidden until a T-Shirt design is selected.
* When a new theme is selected from the "Design" menu, the "Color" field and drop down menu is updated.
* User cannot select two activities that are at the same time.
* Total cost of selected activities is calculated and displayed below the list of activities.
* The "Credit Card" payment option is selected by default.
* Payment option in the select menu matches the payment option displayed on the page.
* When a user chooses a payment option, the chosen payment section is revealed and the other payment sections are hidden.
* The form cannot be submitted (the page does not refresh when the submit button is clicked) until the following requirements have been met:
  * Name field isn’t blank.
  * Email field contains validly formatted e-mail address: (doesn’t have to check that it's a real e-mail address, just that it's formatted like one: dave@teamtreehouse.com, for example).
  * At least one checkbox under "Register for Activities" section must be selected.
  * If "Credit Card" is the selected payment option, the three fields accept only numbers: a 13 to 16-digit credit card number, a 5-digit zip code, and 3-number CVV value.
* On submission, the form provides an error indication or message for each field that requires validation:
  * Name field
  * Email field
  * “Register for Activities” checkboxes
  * Credit Card number, Zip code, and CVV, only if the credit card payment method is selected.
* The form provides two error messages in real time, before the form is submitted.
* The form provides at least one error message that changes depending on the error.
* When JavaScript is disabled, all form fields and payment information is displayed, including the "Other" field under the "Job Role" section.
